*collapse* is a C/C++ based package for data manipulation in R. It's aims are 

1. to facilitate complex data transformation and exploration tasks and 

2. to help make R code fast, flexible, parsimonious and programmer friendly.

This vignette focuses on the integration of *collapse* and the popular *plm* ('Linear Models for Panel Data') package by Yves Croissant and Giovanni Millo. It will demonstrate the utility of the *pseries* and *pdata.frame* classes introduced in *plm* together with the corresponding methods for fast *collapse* functions (implemented in C or C++), to extend and facilitate extremely fast computations on panel-vectors and panel-data.frames (20-100 times faster than native *plm*). The *collapse* package should enable R programmers to - with very little effort - write high-performance code in the domain of panel-data exploration and panel-data econometrics. 

The computations considered are between and within transformations (grouped averaging and centering), higher-dimensional between and within transformations (i.e. averaging and centering over multiple groups), standardizing (i.e. scaling and centering), weighted versions of all of the above, sequences of panel- lags / leads and lagged / leaded and iterated differences and growth rates / log-differences, panel- auto-, partial-auto and cross-correlation functions, panel-data to (ts-) matrix / array conversions, and summary statistics for panel-data. Not really covered in this vignette is the whole suite of *Fast Statistical Functions* in the *collapse* package, which may of course also be used for grouped and weighted operations on panel-data, but currently do not have methods for *plm* classes. 

***

*Note:* To learn more about *collapse*, see the 'Introduction to *collapse*' vignette or the built-in structured documentation available under `help("collapse-documentation")` after installing the package. In addition `help("collapse-package")` provides a compact set of examples for quick-start.

The vignette is structured as follows: 

* In **Part 1** I introduce *collapse*'s fast functions and associated *transformation operators* to compute various transformations on panel-data, and deliver some benchmarks. 
* In **Part 2** I use these functions to explore panel data a bit and introduce additional functions for summary statistics, panel-autocorrelations and testing fixed effects. 
* In **Part 3** finally I provide an example programming application by coding a slightly extended and very efficient Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator. 

For this vignette we will use a dataset (`wlddev`) supplied with *collapse* containing a panel of 4 key development indicators taken from the World Bank Development Indicators Database:

```{r}
library(collapse)

head(wlddev)

fNobs(wlddev)      # This column-wise counts the number of observations

fNdistinct(wlddev) # This counts the number of distinct values
```

## Part 1: Fast Transformation of Panel Data

First let us convert this data to a *plm* panel-data.frame (class *pdata.frame*): 

```{r}
library(plm)

# This creates a panel-data frame
pwlddev <- pdata.frame(wlddev, index = c("iso3c", "year"))

str(pwlddev, give.attr = FALSE)

# A pdata.frame has an index attribute attached [retrieved using index(pwlddev) or attr(pwlddev, "index")]
str(index(pwlddev))

# This shows the individual and time dimensions
pdim(pwlddev)

# This shows which variables vary across which dimensions
pvar(pwlddev)
```

A `plm::pdata.frame` is a data.frame with panel identifiers attached as a list of factors in an *index* attribute (non-factor index variables are converted to factor). Each column in that data.frame is a Panel-Series (`plm::pseries`), which also has the panel identifiers attached:

```{r}
# Panel-Series of GDP per Capita and Life-Expectancy at Birth
PCGDP <- pwlddev$PCGDP
LIFEEX <- pwlddev$LIFEEX
str(LIFEEX)
```

Now that we have explored the basic data structures provided in the *plm* package, let's compute some transformations on them: 

### 1.1 Between and Within Transformations

The functions `fbetween` and `fbetween` can be used to compute efficient between and within transformations on panel vectors and panel data.frames: 

```{r}
# Between-Transformations
head(fbetween(LIFEEX))                        # Between individual (default)

head(fbetween(LIFEEX, effect = "year"))       # Between time

# Within-Transformations
head(fwithin(LIFEEX))                         # Within individuals (default)

head(fwithin(LIFEEX, effect = "year"))        # Within time
```

by default `na.rm = TRUE` thus both functions skip (preserve) missing values in the data (which, by the way, is the default for all *collapse* functions). For `fbetween` the output behavior can be altered with the option `fill`: Setting `fill = TRUE` will compute the group-means on the complete cases in each group (as long as `na.rm = TRUE`), but replace all values in each group with the group mean (hence overwriting or 'filling up' missing values):

```{r}
# This preserves missing values in the output
head(fbetween(PCGDP), 30)              

# This replaces all individuals with the group mean
head(fbetween(PCGDP, fill = TRUE), 30) 
```

For `fwithin` there is also a second method of computation enabled by the argument `add.global.mean = TRUE`, which will add the overall mean of the series back to the data after subtracting out group means. This is to preserve the level of the data (and will only change the intercept when employed in a regression):

```{r}
# This performed standard grouped centering
head(fwithin(LIFEEX))                          

# This adds the overall average Life-Expectancy (across countries) to the country-demeaned series
head(fwithin(LIFEEX, add.global.mean = TRUE))  
```

`fbetween` and `fwithin` can also be applied to panel-data.frames where they will perform these computations variable by variable:

```{r}
head(fbetween(num_vars(pwlddev)), 3)

head(fbetween(num_vars(pwlddev), fill = TRUE), 3)

head(fwithin(num_vars(pwlddev)), 3)

head(fwithin(num_vars(pwlddev), add.global.mean = TRUE), 3)
```

Now next to `fbetween` and `fwithin` there also exist short versions `B` and `W`, which I termed *transformation operators*. These are essentially wrappers around `fbetween` and `fwithin` and provide the same functionality, but are more parsimonious to employ in regression formulas and also offer additional features when applied to panel-data.frames. For panel-series, `B` and `W` are exact analogues to `fbetween` and `fwithin`, just under a shorter name:

```{r}
identical(fbetween(PCGDP), B(PCGDP))
identical(fbetween(PCGDP, fill = TRUE), B(PCGDP, fill = TRUE))
identical(fwithin(PCGDP), W(PCGDP))
identical(fwithin(PCGDP, add.global.mean = TRUE), W(PCGDP, add.global.mean = TRUE))
```

When applied to panel-data.frames, `B` and `W` offer some additional utility by (a) allowing you to select colums to transform using the `cols` argument (default is `cols = is.numeric`, so by default all numeric columns will be selected for transformation), (b) allowing you to add a prefix to the transformed columns with the `stub` argument (default is `stub = "B."` for `B` and `stub = "W."` for `W`) and (c) preserving the panel-id's with the `keep.ids` argument (default `keep.ids = TRUE`):

```{r}
head(B(pwlddev), 3)

head(W(pwlddev, cols = 9:12), 3) # Here using the cols argument
```

<!-- The main philosophy behind having transformation operators like `B` and `W` is that they are more parsimonious to use ad-hoc (i.e. to demean a variable in a regression formula), and also offer more convenient output for ad-hoc computations on data.frames, whereas the corresponding functions `fbetween` and `fwithin` are a bit simpler in terms of R-code (and thus a tiny bit faster) and also more convenient for programming since they require all inputs to be provided in terms of data.  -->

`fbetween / B` and `fwithin / W` also support weighted computations. This of course applies more to panel-survey settings, but for the sake of illustration suppose we wanted to weight our between and within transformations by the amount of ODA these countries received:

```{r}
# This replaces values by the ODA-weighted group mean and also preserves the weight variable (ODA, argument keep.w = TRUE)
head(B(pwlddev, w = ~ ODA), 3)

# This centers values on the ODA-weighted group mean
head(W(pwlddev, w = ~ ODA, cols = c("PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI")), 3)

# This centers values on the ODA-weighted group mean and also adds the overall ODA-weighted mean of the data
head(W(pwlddev, w = ~ ODA, cols = c("PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI"), add.global.mean = TRUE), 3)
```

As shown above, with `B` and `W` the weight column can also be passed as a formula or character string, whereas `fbetween` and `fwithin` require the all inputs to be passed directly in terms of data (i.e. `fbetween(get_vars(pwlddev, 9:11), w = pwlddev$ODA)`), and the weight vector or id colums are never preserved in the output. Therefore in most applications `B` and `W` are probably more convenient for quick use, whereas `fbetween` and `fwithin` are the preferred programmers choice, also because they have a little less R-overhead which makes them a tiny bit faster.

### 1.2 Higher-Dimensional Between and Within Transformations

Analogous to `fbetween / B` and `fwithin / W`, *collapse* provides a duo of functions and operators `fHDbetween / HDB` and `fHDwithin / HDW` to efficiently average and center data on multiple groups. The credit herefore goes to Simen Gaure, the author of the *lfe* package who wrote an efficient C- implementation of the alternating-projections algorithm to perform this task. `fHDbetween / HDB` and `fHDwithin / HDW` enrich this implementation (available in the function `lfe::demeanlist`) by providing more options regarding missing values, and also allowing continuous covariates and (full) interactions to be projected out alongside factors. The methods for *pseries* and *pdata.frame*'s are however rather simple, as they simply simultaneously center panel-vectors on all panel-identifiers in the index (which can be more than 2):

```{r}
# This simultaneously averages Life-Expectancy across countries and years 
head(HDB(LIFEEX)) # (same as running a regression on country and year dummies and taking the fitted values)

# This simultaneously centers Life-Expectenacy on countries and years 
head(HDW(LIFEEX)) # (same as running a regression on country and year dummies and taking the residuals)
```

The architecture of `fHDbetween / HDB` and `fHDwithin / HDW` differs a bit from `fbetween / B` and `fwithin / W`. This is essentially a consequence of the underlying C-implementation (accessed through `lfe::demeanlist`), which was not built to accommodate missing values. `fHDbetween / HDB` and `fHDwithin / HDW` therefore both have an argument `fill = TRUE` (the default), which stipulates that missing values in the data are preserved in the output. The *collapse* default `na.rm = TRUE` again ensures that only complete cases are used for the computation:

```{r}
# Missing values are preserved in the output when fill = TRUE (the default)
head(HDB(PCGDP), 30)  

# When fill = FALSE, only the complete cases are returned
nofill <- HDB(PCGDP, fill = FALSE)
head(nofill, 30)

# This results in a shorter panel-vector 
length(nofill)   
length(PCGDP)

# The cases that were missing and removed from the output are available as an attribute
head(attr(nofill, "na.rm"), 30)
```

In the *pdata.frame* methods there are 3 different choices how to deal with missing values. The default for the *plm* classes in `variable.wise = TRUE`, which will essentially sequentially apply `fHDbetween.pseries` and `fHDwithin.pseries` (with the default `fill = TRUE`) to all columns. This is the same behavior as in `fbetween / B` and `fwithin / W`, which also consider the column-wise complete obs:

```{r}
# This column-wise centers the data on countries and years
tail(HDW(pwlddev), 10)
```

If `variable.wise = FALSE`, `fHDbetween / HDB` and `fHDwithin / HDW` will only consider the complete cases in the dataset, but still return a dataset of the same dimensions (as long as `fill = TRUE`), resulting in some rows all-missing:

```{r}
# This centers the complete cases of the data data on countries and years and keeps missing cases
tail(HDW(pwlddev, variable.wise = FALSE), 10)
```

Finally, if also `fill = FALSE`, the behavior is the same as in the *pseries* method: Missing cases are removed from the data:

```{r}
# This centers the complete cases of the data data on countries and years, and removes missing cases
res <- HDW(pwlddev, fill = FALSE)
tail(res, 10)

tail(attr(res, "na.rm"))
```

<!-- Again it is possible to perform weighted higher-order transformations, but the weight vector is not preserved and this -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # This centers the complete cases of the data data on countries and years, and removes missing cases -->
<!-- HDW(pwlddev, w = pwlddev$ODA, cols = 9:11, fill = FALSE, variable.wise = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

*Notes: * (1) Because of the different missing case options and associated challenges, panel-identifiers are not preserved in `HDB` and `HDW`. (2) The default `variable.wise = TRUE` and `fill = TRUE` was only set for the *pseries* and *pdata.frame* methods, to harmonize the default implementations with `fbetween / B` and `fwithin / W` for these classes. In the standard *default*, *matrix* and *data.frame* methods, the defaults are `variable.wise = FALSE` and `fill = FALSE` (i.e. missing cases are removed beforehand), which is generally more efficient. 


### 1.3 Scaling and Centering

Next to the above functions for grouped centering and averaging, the function / operator pair `fscale / STD` can be used to efficiently standardize (i.e. scale and center) panel data along an arbitrary dimension. The architecture is identical to that of `fwithin / W` or `fbetween / B`.  

```{r}
# This standardizes GDP per capita in each country
STD_PCGDP <- STD(PCGDP)

# Checks: 
head(fmean(STD_PCGDP, index(STD_PCGDP, 1)))
head(fsd(STD_PCGDP, index(STD_PCGDP, 1)))

# This standardizes GDP per capita in each year
STD_PCGDP_T <- STD(PCGDP, effect = "year")

# Checks: 
head(fmean(STD_PCGDP_T, index(STD_PCGDP_T, 2)))
head(fsd(STD_PCGDP_T, index(STD_PCGDP_T, 2)))
```

And similarly for *pdata.frame*'s:

```{r}
head(STD(pwlddev, cols = 9:12))

head(STD(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, effect = "year"))
```

Scaling without centering can be done with the `fsd` function using:

```{r}
head(fsd(get_vars(pwlddev, 9:12), pwlddev$iso3c, TRA = "/"))
```

Again, the *Fast Statistical Functions* in *collapse* do not have methods for *pseries* or *pdata.frame*'s (yet). 

### 1.4 Panel Lags / Leads, Differences and Growth Rates

A proper *and* fast implementation of panel- lags, differences and growth rates has been missing in R so far. With 'proper' I mean an implementation that does not require panel-vectors to be sorted (amounting i.e. to a grouped-lag on sorted data), but that takes into account both individual an time-identifiers in the computation. `plm::lag` and `dplyr::lag` (with the `order_by` argument) provide proper implementations but rely on base-R (split-apply-combine logic) which makes them slow. `data.table::shift` allows for pretty fast grouped lags on sorted data, but without taking into account the time-identifiers (i.e. 'improper', you can do something like `DT[oder(time), shift(col1), by = pid]` in *data.table* but that sorts the data and is definitely more computationally expensive than the implementation introduced here). 

With `flag / L / F`, `fdiff / D` and `fgrowth / G`, *collapse* provides a fast and comprehensive C++ based solution to the computation of (sequences of) lags / leads and (sequences of) lagged / leaded and suitably iterated differences and growth rates / log-differences on panel-data. The *pseries* and *pdata.frame* methods to these functions and associated *transformation operators* automatically use the panel-identifiers in the 'index' attached to these objects (where the last variable in the 'index' is taken as the time-variable and the variables before that are taken as individual identifiers) to perform fast fully-identified time-dependent operations on panel-data, without the need of sorting the data.

With `flag / L / F`, it is easy to lag or lead *pseries*:

```{r}
# A panel-lag
head(flag(LIFEEX))      

# A panel-lead
head(flag(LIFEEX, -1))

# The lag and lead operators are even more parsimonious to employ:
all_identical(L(LIFEEX), flag(LIFEEX), plm::lag(LIFEEX))
all_identical(F(LIFEEX), flag(LIFEEX, -1), plm::lead(LIFEEX))
```

It is also possible to compute a sequence of lags / leads using `flag` or one of the operators:

```{r}
# sequence of panel- lags and leads
head(flag(LIFEEX, -1:3))

all_identical(L(LIFEEX, -1:3), F(LIFEEX, 1:-3), flag(LIFEEX, -1:3))

# The native plm implementation also returns a matrix of lags but with different column names
head(plm::lag(LIFEEX, -1:3), 4)
# Just the meaning is a bit ambiguous...
head(plm::lead(LIFEEX, 1:-3), 4)
```

Of course the lag orders may be unevenly spaced, i.e. `L(x, -1:3*12)` would compute seasonal lags on monthly data. On *pdata.frame*'s, the effects of `flag` and `L / F` differ insofar that `flag` will just lag the entire dataset without preserving identifiers (although the index attribute is always preserved), whereas `L / F` by default (`cols = is.numeric`) select the numeric variables and add the panel-id's on the left (default `keep.ids = TRUE`): 

```{r}
# This lags the entire data
head(flag(pwlddev))

# This lags only numeric columns and preserves panel-id's
head(L(pwlddev))

# This lags only columns 9 through 12 and preserves panel-id's
head(L(pwlddev, cols = 9:12))
```

We can also easily compute a sequence of lags / leads on a panel-data.frame:

```{r}
# This lags only columns 9 through 12 and preserves panel-id's
head(L(pwlddev, -1:3, cols = 9:12))
```

Essentially the same functionality applies to `fdiff / D` and `fgrowth / G`, with the main differences that these functions also have a `diff` argument to determine the number of iterations:

```{r}
# Panel-difference of Life Expectancy
head(fdiff(LIFEEX))

# Second panel-difference
head(fdiff(LIFEEX, diff = 2))

# Panel-growth rate of Life Expectancy
head(fgrowth(LIFEEX))

# Growth rate of growth rate of Life Expectancy
head(fgrowth(LIFEEX, diff = 2))

identical(D(LIFEEX), fdiff(LIFEEX))
identical(G(LIFEEX), fgrowth(LIFEEX))
identical(fdiff(LIFEEX), diff(LIFEEX)) # Same as plm::diff.pseries (which does not compute iterated panel-differences)
```

By default, growth rates are calculated as `(x - lag(x)) / lag(x) * 100`, but we can also compute growth rates based on log-differences which are often used in economics for various reasons (i.e. symmetry, exponential trends on macro-series, heteroskedasticity, properties of the log etc..). In that case the formula is `(log(x) - lag(log(x))) * 100` or `log(x/lag(x)) * 100`:

```{r}
# Panel log-difference (growth rate) of Life Expectancy
head(fgrowth(LIFEEX, logdiff = TRUE))

# Panel log-difference (growth rate) of log-difference (growth rate) of Life Expectancy
head(fgrowth(LIFEEX, diff = 2, logdiff = TRUE))

identical(G(LIFEEX, logdiff = TRUE), fgrowth(LIFEEX, logdiff = TRUE))
```

It is also possible to compute sequences of lagged / leaded and iterated differences and growth rates:

```{r}
# first and second forward-difference and first and second difference of lags 1-3 of Life-Expectancy
head(D(LIFEEX, -1:3, 1:2))

# Same with (exact) growth rates
head(G(LIFEEX, -1:3, 1:2))

# Same with Log-differences (growth rates)
head(G(LIFEEX, -1:3, 1:2, logdiff = TRUE))
```

Another important advantage of the *collapse* functions compared to `plm::lag` or `plm::diff` is that the panel-identifiers are preserved, even if a matrix of lags / leads / differences or growth rates is returned. This allows for nested panel-computations, for example we can compute shifted sequences of lagged / leaded and iterated panel differences:

```{r}
# Sequence of differneces (same as above), adding one extra lag of the whole sequence
head(L(D(LIFEEX, -1:3, 1:2), 0:1))

```

All of this naturally generalized to computations on *pdata.frames*:

```{r}
head(D(pwlddev, -1:3, 1:2, cols = 9:10), 3)

head(L(D(pwlddev, -1:3, 1:2, cols = 9:10), 0:1), 3)
```

### 1.5 Panel-Data to Array Conversions

Viewing and transforming panel-data stored in an array can be a powerful strategy, especially as it provides much more direct access to the different dimensions of the data. The function `psmat` can be used to efficiently transform *pseries* to a 2D matrix, and *pdata.frame*'s to a 3D array:

```{r}
# Converting the panel-series to array, individual rows (default)
str(psmat(LIFEEX))

# Converting the panel-series to array, individual columns
str(psmat(LIFEEX, transpose = TRUE))

# Same as plm::as.matrix.pseries, apart from attributes
identical(`attributes<-`(psmat(LIFEEX), NULL),        
          `attributes<-`(as.matrix(LIFEEX), NULL)) 
identical(`attributes<-`(psmat(LIFEEX, transpose = TRUE), NULL), 
          `attributes<-`(as.matrix(LIFEEX, idbyrow = FALSE), NULL)) 
```

Applying `psmat` to a *pdata.frame* yields a 3D array:

```{r}
psar <- psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12)
str(psar)

str(psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, transpose = TRUE))
```

This format can be very convenient to quickly and freely access data for different countries, variables and time-periods:

```{r}
# Looking at wealth, health and inequality in Brazil and Argentinia, 1990-1999
aperm(psar[c("BRA","ARG"), as.character(1990:1999), c("PCGDP", "LIFEEX", "GINI")])
```

`psmat` can also return the output as a list of panel-series matrices:

```{r}
pslist <- psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, array = FALSE)
str(pslist)
```

This list can then be unlisted using the function `unlist2d` (for unlisting in 2-dimensions), to yield a reshaped data.frame:
```{r}
head(unlist2d(pslist, idcols = "Variable", row.names = "Country Code"), 3)
```

Of course we could also have applied some transformation (like computing pairwise correlations) to each matrix before unlisting. In any case this kind of programming provides lots of possibilities to explore and manipulate panel data (as we will see in Part 2). 

### Benchmarks

Below I benchmark the *collapse* implementation against native *plm*. To do that I extend the dataset used so far to have approx 1 million observations: 

```{r, eval=NCRAN}
wlddevsmall <- get_vars(wlddev, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI","ODA"))
wlddevsmall$iso3c <- as.character(wlddevsmall$iso3c)
data <- replicate(100, wlddevsmall, simplify = FALSE)
rm(wlddevsmall)
uniquify <- function(x, i) {
  x$iso3c <- paste0(x$iso3c, i)
  x
}
data <- unlist2d(Map(uniquify, data, as.list(1:100)), idcols = FALSE)
data <- pdata.frame(data, index = c("iso3c", "year"))
pdim(data)
```

The data has 21600 individuals (countries) each observed for 59 years, the total number of rows is 1274400. We can pull out a series of life expectancy and run some benchmarks. My windows laptop on which these benchmarks were run has a 2x 2.2 GHZ Intel i5 processor, 8GB DDR3 RAM and a Samsung SSD hard drive (so a decent laptop but nothing fancy). 

```{r, eval=NCRAN}
# Creating the extended panel-series for Life Expectancy (l for large)

str(LIFEEX_l)

# Between Transformations
system.time(Between(LIFEEX_l, na.rm = TRUE))
system.time(fbetween(LIFEEX_l))

system.time(fdiff(LIFEEX_l, -1:3, 1:2))

# Single Growth Rate
system.time(fgrowth(LIFEEX_l))

# Single Log-Difference
system.time(fgrowth(LIFEEX_l, logdiff = TRUE))

# Panel-Series to Matrix Conversion
# system.time(as.matrix(LIFEEX_l))  This takes about 3 minutes to compute
system.time(psmat(LIFEEX_l))
```

The results show that I did not promise to much in the introduction. A speed gain of 20-40x is the norm, and for certain operations such as the sequence of lags and leads the speed gain is about 100x, and for the panel-series to matrix conversion a 300x speed gain by using *collapse* vs. native *plm*. I am sure some will want to see a comparison with *data.table*:

```{r, eval=NCRAN}
system.time(L(data, cols = 3:6))
library(data.table)
setDT(data)
# 'Improper' panel-lag
system.time(data[, shift(.SD), by = iso3c, .SDcols = 3:6])

# This does what L is actually doing (without sorting the data)
system.time(data[order(year), shift(.SD), by = iso3c, .SDcols = 3:6]) 
```

The above dataset has 1 million obs in 20 thousand groups, but what about 10 million obs and 1 million groups? Do *collapse* functions scale efficiently as data and the number of groups grows large? Here is a simple benchmark:  

```{r, eval=NCRAN}
x <- rnorm(1e7)                                     # 10 million obs
g <- qF(rep(1:1e6, each = 10), na.exclude = FALSE)  # 1 million individuals
t <- qF(rep(1:10, 1e6), na.exclude = FALSE)         # 10 time-periods per individual

system.time(fbetween(x, g))
system.time(fwithin(x, g))
system.time(flag(x, 1, g, t))
system.time(flag(x, -1:1, g, t))
system.time(fdiff(x, 1, 1, g, t))
system.time(fdiff(x, 1, 2, g, t))
system.time(fdiff(x, -1:1, 1:2, g, t))
```

The message is clear: *collapse* functions perform very well even as the number of groups grows large, in fact tests show that the large sample performance for aggregations with *collapse* is similar to *data.table*, and *collapse* grouped transformations like the ones shown here are generally faster than what can be done *data.table*. 

The conclusion of this benchmark analysis is that *collapse*'s fast functions, with or without the help of *plm* classes, allow for very fast transformations of panel-data, and should enable R programmers and econometricians to implement high-performance panel-data estimators without having to dive into C/C++ themselves or resorting to *data.table* metaprogramming. 

## Part 2: Fast Exploration of Panel-Data

*collapse* also provides some essential functions to summarize and explore panel data, such as fast summary-statistics for panel-data, panel-auto, partial-auto and cross-correlation functions, and a fast F-test to test fixed effects and other exclusion restrictions on (large) panel-data models. I also offer some suggestions on applying simple correlational and unsupervised learning tools to panel-series matrices to learn more about the data. 


### 2.1 Summary Statistics for Panel-Data

Efficient summary statistics for panel data have long been implemented in other statistical softwares. The command `qsu`, shorthand for 'quick-summary', is a very efficient summary statistics command inspired by the *xtsummarize* command in the STATA statistical software. It computes a default set of 5 statistics (N, mean, sd, min and max) and can also computed higher moments (skewness and kurtosis) in a single pass through the data (using a numerically stable online algorithm generalized from Welford's Algorithm for variance computations). With panel-data, `qsu` computes these statistics not just on the raw data, but also on the between-transformed and within-transformed data: 

```{r}
qsu(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, higher = TRUE)
```

Key statistics to look at in this summary are the sample size and the standard-deviation decomposed into the between-individuals and the within-individuals standard-deviation: For GDP per Capita we have 8995 observations in the panel series for 203 countries, with on average 44.31 observations (time-periods T) per country. The between-country standard deviation is 19600 USD, around 3-times larger than the within-country (over-time) standard deviation of 6300 USD. Regarding the mean, the Between-Mean computed as a cross-sectional average of country averages usually differs slightly from the overall average taken across all data points. The within-transformed data is computed and summarized with the overall mean added back (i.e. as in `fwithin(PCGDP, add.global.mean = TRUE)`). 

We can also do groupwise panel-statistics and `qsu` also supports weights. For the sake of illustration, below I summarize the data by income group with unit weights^[Which of course amounts to the same as omitting the weights]:

```{r}
qsu(pwlddev, ~ income, w = rep(1, nrow(pwlddev)), cols = 9:12, higher = TRUE)
```

Here it should be noted that any grouping is applied independently from the data-transformation, that is the data is first transformed, and then grouped statistics are calculated on the transformed data. The computation of statistics is very efficient. Here I summarize the extended life-expectancy series used in the benchmarks in Part 1: 

```{r, eval=NCRAN}
qsu(LIFEEX_l)

system.time(qsu(LIFEEX_l))
```

Using the transformation functions and the functions `pwcor` and `pwcov`, we can also easily explore the aggregate correlation structure of the data:

```{r}
# Overall pairwise correlations with pairwise observation count and significance testing (* = significant at 5% level)
pwcor(get_vars(pwlddev, 9:12), N = TRUE, P = TRUE)

# Between correlations
pwcor(fmean(get_vars(pwlddev, 9:12), pwlddev$iso3c), N = TRUE, P = TRUE)

# Within correlations
pwcor(W(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, keep.ids = FALSE), N = TRUE, P = TRUE)
```

The correlations show that the between (cross-country) relationships between these macro-variables are quite strong, but within countries the relationships are much weaker, for example there seems to be no significant relationship between GDP per Capita and either inequality or ODA received within countries over time. 

### 2.2 Exploring Panel-Data in Matrix / Array Form

We can take a single panel-series such as GDP per Capita and explore it further:
<!-- The function `psmat` very efficiently generates a matrix from the series: -->
<!-- , fig.width=15 -->
```{r} 
# Generating a (transposed) matrix of country GDPs per capita
tGDPmat <- psmat(PCGDP, transpose = TRUE)
tGDPmat[1:10, 1:10]

# plot the matrix (it will plot correctly no matter how the matrix is transposed)
plot(tGDPmat, main = "GDP per Capita")

# Taking series with more than 20 observation
suffsamp <- tGDPmat[, fNobs(tGDPmat) > 20]

# Minimum pairwise observations between any two series: 
min(pwNobs(suffsamp))

# We can use the pairwise-correlations of the annual growth rates to hierarchically cluster the economies:
plot(hclust(as.dist(1-pwcor(G(suffsamp)))))

# Finally we could do PCA on the Growth Rates:
eig <- eigen(pwcor(G(suffsamp)))
plot(seq_col(suffsamp), eig$values/sum(eig$values)*100, xlab = "Number of Principal Components", ylab = "% Variance Explained", main = "Screeplot")

```

There is also a nice plot-method applied to panel-series arrays returned when `psmat` is applied to a panel-data.frame:

```{r, fig.height=8}
plot(psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12), legend = TRUE)
```

<!-- Returning a list of panel-series matrices allows efficient unlisting to data.frame, although of course there are other ways to reshape data in this way (i.e. `reshape2`, `tidyr`): -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # head(unlist2d(psmat(pwlddev, cols = 9:12, array = FALSE), idcols = "Variable", row.names = "Country Code")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

Above we have explored the cross-sectional relationship between the different national GDP series. Now we explore the time-dependence of the panel-vectors as a whole: 

### 2.3 Panel- Auto-, Partial-Auto and Cross-Correlation Functions

The functions `psacf`, `pspacf` and `psccf` mimic `stats::acf`, `stats::pacf` and `stats::ccf` for panel-vectors and panel data.frames. Below I show the panel-series autocorrelation function of the data:

```{r}
psacf(pwlddev, cols = 9:12)
```

The computation is conducted by first scaling and centering (i.e. standardizing) the panel-vectors by groups (using `fscale`, default argument `gscale = TRUE`), and then taking the covariance of each series with a matrix of properly computed panel-lags of itself (using `flag`), and dividing that by the variance of the overall series (using `fvar`). 

In a similar way we can compute the Partial-ACF (using a multivariate Yule-Walker decomposition on the ACF, as in `stats::pacf`):

```{r}
pspacf(pwlddev, cols = 9:12)
```

and the panel-cross-correlation function between GDP per capita and life expectancy (which is already contained in the ACF plot above):

```{r}
psccf(PCGDP, LIFEEX)
```

### 2.4 Testing for Individual Specific and Time-Effects

As a final step of exploration, we could analyze our series and simple models for the significance and explanatory power of individual or time-fixed effects, without going all the way to running a Hausman Test of fixed vs. random effects on a fully specified model. The main function here is `fFtest` which efficiently computes a fast R-Squared based F-test of exclusion restrictions on models potentially involving many factors. By default (argument `full.df = TRUE`) the degrees of freedom of the test are adjusted to make it identical to the F-statistic from regressing the series on a set of country and time dummies^[In fact factors are projected out using `lfe::demeanlist` and no regression is run at all].

```{r}
# Testing GDP per Capita
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP))    # Testing individual and time-fixed effects
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP, 1)) # Testing individual effects
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP, 2)) # Testing time effects

# Same for Life-Expectancy
fFtest(LIFEEX, index(LIFEEX))    # Testing individual and time-fixed effects
fFtest(LIFEEX, index(LIFEEX, 1)) # Testing individual effects
fFtest(LIFEEX, index(LIFEEX, 2)) # Testing time effects

```
Below I test the correlation between the country and time-means of GDP and Life-Expectancy:
```{r}
cor.test(B(PCGDP), B(LIFEEX)) # Testing correlation of country means

cor.test(B(PCGDP, effect = 2), B(LIFEEX, effect = 2)) # Same for time-means
```

We can also test for the significance of individual and time-fixed effects (or both) in the regression of GDP on life expectancy and ODA received:

```{r}
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP), get_vars(pwlddev, c("LIFEEX","ODA")))    # Testing individual and time-fixed effects
fFtest(PCGDP, index(PCGDP, 2), get_vars(pwlddev, c("iso3c","LIFEEX","ODA")))    # Testing time-fixed effects
```

As can be expected in this cross-country data, individual and time-fixed effects play a large role in explaining the data, and these effects are correlated across series, suggesting that a fixed-effects model with both types of fixed-effects would be appropriate. To round things off, below I compute the Hausman test of Fixed vs. Random effects, which confirms these conclusion:   

```{r}
phtest(PCGDP ~ LIFEEX, data = pwlddev)
```

<!-- summary(plm(PCGDP ~ lag(LIFEEX, 0:3), data = pwlddev, model = "within")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Part 3: Programming Panel-Data Estimators 

A central goal of the *collapse* package is to facilitate advanced and fast programming with data. A prime area of application for the functions introduced above is to program efficient panel-data estimators. In this section I provide a short example of how this can be done. The application will be an implementation of the Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator, considering a more general case than currently implemented in the *plm* package:

In Hausman and Taylor (1981), in a more general scenario, we have a linear panel-model of the form $$y_{it} = \beta_1X_{1it} + \beta_2X_{2it} + \beta_3Z_{1i} + \beta_4Z_{2i} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon$$ where $\alpha_i$ denotes unobserved individual specific effects and $\gamma_t$ denotes unobserved global events. This model has up to 4 kinds of covariates:  

* Time-Varying covariates $X_{1it}$ that are uncorrelated with the individual specific effect $\alpha_i$, such that $E[X_{1it}\alpha_i] = 0$. It may be the case that $E[X_{1it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$
* Time-Varying covariates $X_{2it}$ with $E[X_{2it}\alpha_i] \neq 0$ and possibly $E[X_{2it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$
* Time-Invariant covariates $Z_{1i}$ with $E[Z_{1i}\alpha_i] = 0$
* Time-Invariant covariates $Z_{2i}$ with $E[Z_{2i}\alpha_i] \neq 0$

Now the main problem arises from $E[Z_{2i}\alpha_i] \neq 0$, which would usually prevent us from estimating $\beta_4$ since taking a within-transformation (fixed effects) would remove $Z_{2i}$ from the equation. Hausman and Taylor (1981) stipulated that since $E[X_{1it}\alpha_i] = 0$, once could use $X_{1i.}$ i.e. the between-transformed $X_{1it}$ to instrument for $Z_{2i}$. They propose an IV/2SLS estimation of the whole equation where the within-transformed covariates $\tilde{X}_{1it}$ and $\tilde{X}_{2it}$ are used to instrument $X_{1it}$ and $X_{2it}$, and $X_{1i.}$ instruments $Z_{2i}$. Assuming that missing values have been removed beforehand, and also taking into account the possibility that $E[X_{1it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$ and $E[X_{2it}\gamma_t] \neq 0$ (i.e. accounting for time fixed-effects), this estimator can be coded as follows:


  <!-- # This function converts atomic vectors passed to named lists -->
  <!-- ln <- function(x, nam) if(!is.null(x) && is.atomic(x)) `names<-`(list(x), nam) else x  -->

  <!-- # Create instrument matrix: if time.FE, higher-order demean X1 and X2, else normal demeaning -->
  <!-- IVS <- do.call(cbind, c(ln(if(time.FE) fHDwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE), "W.X1"),  -->
  <!--             ln(fbetween(X1, na.rm = FALSE), "B.X1"), ln(Z1, "Z1"), -->
  <!--             ln(if(is.null(X2)) X2 else if(time.FE) fHDwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE), "W.X2"))) -->

  <!-- # Create matrix of independent variables -->
  <!-- X <- do.call(cbind, c(ln(X1, "X1"), ln(X2, "X2"), ln(Z1, "Z1"), ln(Z2, "Z2")))  -->


```{r}
HT_est <- function(y, X1, Z2, X2 = NULL, Z1 = NULL, time.FE = FALSE) {
  
  # Create matrix of independent variables
  X <- do.call(cbind, c(X1, X2, Z1, Z2)) 
  
  # Create instrument matrix: if time.FE, higher-order demean X1 and X2, else normal demeaning
  IVS <- do.call(cbind, c(if(time.FE) fHDwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X1, na.rm = FALSE), 
                 if(is.null(X2)) X2 else if(time.FE) fHDwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE) else fwithin(X2, na.rm = FALSE),
                 Z1, fbetween(X1, na.rm = FALSE)))
  
  if(length(IVS) == length(X)) { # The IV estimator case
    return(drop(solve(crossprod(IVS, X), crossprod(IVS, y))))
  } else { # The 2SLS case
    Xhat <- qr.fitted(qr(IVS), X)  # First stage
    return(drop(qr.coef(qr(Xhat), y)))   # Second stage
  }
}
```

The estimator is written in such a way that variables of the type $X_{2it}$ and $Z_{1i}$ are optional, and it also includes an option as to whether time fixed effects are also projected out or not. The expected inputs for $X_{1it}$ (`X1`), and $X_{2it}$ (`X2`) are column-subsets of a *pdata.frame*. 

Having coded the estimator, it would be good to have an example to run it on. I have tried to squeeze an example out of the `wlddev` data used so far in this vignette. It is quite crappy and suffers from a weak-IV problem, but for there sake of illustration lets do it: 
We want to estimate the panel-regression of life-expectancy on GDP per Capita, ODA received, the GINI index and a time-invariant dummy indicating whether the country is an OECD member. All variables except the dummy enter in logs, so this is an elasticity regression. 
<!-- dat <- droplevels(na.omit(get_vars(wlddev, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","GINI","LIFEEX","ODA")))) -->
<!-- get_vars(dat, 4:7) <- log(get_vars(dat, 4:7)) -->
<!-- dat <- pdata.frame(dat, index = c("iso3c", "year")) -->
<!-- dat$OECD <- as.numeric(dat$OECD) # Creating OECD dummy -->

<!-- # This tests each oth the covariates is correlated with with alpha_i -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ PCGDP, dat) -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ LIFEEX, dat) -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ GINI, dat) -->
<!-- phtest(ODA ~ PCGDP + LIFEEX + GINI, dat) -->

<!-- # We expect ODA membershi -->
<!-- cor.test(dat$OECD, B(dat$ODA)) -->


<!-- fe <- fixef(plm(ODA ~ PCGDP + LIFEEX + GINI, dat)) -->

<!-- cor.test(fe, fmean(dat$OECD, index(dat, 1))) -->

```{r, warning=FALSE}
dat <- get_vars(wlddev, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI","ODA"))
get_vars(dat, 4:7) <- log(get_vars(dat, 4:7))       # Taking logs of the data
dat$OECD <- as.numeric(dat$OECD)                    # Creating OECD dummy
dat <- pdata.frame(droplevels(na.omit(dat)),        # Creating Panel-data.frame, after removing missing values
                   index = c("iso3c", "year"))      # and dropping unused factor levels
pdim(dat)
pvar(dat)
```

Using the GINI index cost a lot of observations and brought the sample size down from 12000 to under 1000, but the GINI index will be a key variable in what follows. Clearly the OECD dummy is time-invariant. Below I run Hausman-tests of fixed vs. random effects to determine which covariates might be correlated with the unobserved individual effects, and which model would be most appropriate. 

```{r}
# This tests each oth the covariates is correlated with with alpha_i
phtest(LIFEEX ~ PCGDP, dat)  # Likely correlated !
phtest(LIFEEX ~ ODA, dat)    # Likely correlated !
phtest(LIFEEX ~ GINI, dat)   # Likely not correlated !!
phtest(LIFEEX ~ PCGDP + ODA + GINI, dat)  # Fixed Effects is the appropriate model for this regression
```

The tests suggest that both GDP per Capita and ODA are correlated with country-specific unobservables affecting life-expectancy, and overall a fixed-effects model would be appropriate. However, the Hausman test on the GINI index fails to reject: Country specific unobservables affecting life-expectancy are not necessarily correlated with the level of inequality across countries.

Now if we want to include the OECD dummy in the regression, we cannot use fixed-effects as this would wipe-out the dummy as well. If the dummy is uncorrelated with the country-specific unobservables affecting life-expectancy (the $\alpha_i$), then we could use a solution suggested by Mundlak (1978) and simply add between-transformed versions of PCGDP and ODA in the regression (in addition to PCGDP and ODA in levels), and so 'control' for the part of PCGDP and ODA correlated with the $\alpha_i$ (in the IV literature this is known as the control-function approach to IV estimation). If however the OECD dummy is correlated with the $\alpha_i$, then we need to use the Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator. Below I suggest 2 methods of testing this correlation: 

```{r}
# Testing the correlation between OECD dummy and the Between-transformed Life-Expectancy (i.e. not accounting for other covariates)
cor.test(dat$OECD, B(dat$LIFEEX)) # -> Significant correlation of 0.21
 
# Getting the fixed-effects (estimates of alpha_i) from the model (i.e. accounting for the other covariates)
fe <- fixef(plm(LIFEEX ~ PCGDP + ODA + GINI, dat, model = "within"))
mODA <- fmean(dat$ODA, dat$iso3c)
# Again testing the correlation
cor.test(fe, mODA[match(names(fe), names(mODA))]) # -> Not Significant.. but probably due to small sample size, the correlation is still 0.13
```

I interpret the test results as rejecting the hypothesis that the dummy is uncorrelated with $\alpha_i$, thus we do have a case for Hausman and Taylor (1981) here: the OECD dummy is a $Z_{2i}$ with $E[Z_{2i}\alpha_i]\neq 0$. The Hausman tests above suggested that the GINI index is the only variable uncorrelated with $\alpha_i$, thus GINI is $X_{1it}$ with $E[X_{1it}\alpha_i] = 0$. Finally PCGDP and ODA jointly constitute $X_{2it}$, where the Hausman tests strongly suggested that $E[X_{2it}\alpha_i] \neq 0$. We do not have a $Z_{1i}$ in this setup, i.e. a time-invariant variable uncorrelated with the $\alpha_i$. 


The Hausman and Taylor (1981) estimator suggests that we should instrument the OECD dummy with $X_{1i.}$, the between-transformed GINI index. Let us therefore test the regression of the dummy on this instrument to see of it would be a good (i.e. relevant) instrument: 

```{r}
# This computes the regression of OECD on the GINI instrument: Weak IV problem !!
fFtest(dat$OECD, B(dat$GINI))

```

The 0 R-Squared and the F-Statistic of 0.21 suggest that the instrument is very weak indeed, rubbish to be precise, thus the implementation of the HT estimator below is also a rubbish example, but it is still good for illustration purposes: 

```{r}
HT_est(y = dat$LIFEEX, 
       X1 = get_vars(dat, "GINI"), 
       Z2 = get_vars(dat, "OECD"),
       X2 = get_vars(dat, c("PCGDP","ODA"))) 
```

Now a central questions is of course: How computationally efficient is this estimator? Let us try to re-run it on the data generated for the benchmark in Part 1:

```{r, eval=NCRAN}
dat <- get_vars(data, c("iso3c","year","OECD","PCGDP","LIFEEX","GINI","ODA"))
get_vars(dat, 4:7) <- log(get_vars(dat, 4:7))       # Taking logs of the data
dat$OECD <- as.numeric(dat$OECD)                    # Creating OECD dummy
dat <- pdata.frame(droplevels(na.omit(dat)),        # Creating Panel-data.frame, after removing missing values
                   index = c("iso3c", "year"))      # and dropping unused factor levels
pdim(dat)
pvar(dat)

library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(HT_est = HT_est(y = dat$LIFEEX,     # The estimator as before
                      X1 = get_vars(dat, "GINI"),
                      Z2 = get_vars(dat, "OECD"),
                      X2 = get_vars(dat, c("PCGDP","ODA"))),
              HT_est_TFE =  HT_est(y = dat$LIFEEX, # Also Projecting out Time-FE
                      X1 = get_vars(dat, "GINI"),
                      Z2 = get_vars(dat, "OECD"),
                      X2 = get_vars(dat, c("PCGDP","ODA")),
                      time.FE = TRUE))
```

At around 100000 obs and 13000 groups in an unbalanced panel, the computation involving 3 grouped centering and 1 grouped averaging task as well as 2 list-to matrix conversions and an IV-procedure took on about 10 milliseconds with only individual effects, and about 40 - 45 milliseconds with individual and time-fixed effects (projected out iteratively). This should leave some room for running this on much larger data, and even for implementing a bootstrap standard error at this sample size. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(oldopts)
```
