World Development Dataset
}
\description{
This dataset contains 4 indicators from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database: (1) GDP per capita, (2) Life expectancy at birth, (3) GINI index and (4) Net ODA received. The panel-data is balanced and covers 216 present and historic countries from 1960-2018 (World Bank aggregates and regional entities are excluded).

Apart from the indicators the data contains a number of identifiers (character country name, factor ISO3 country code, World Bank region and income level, numeric year and decade) and 2 generated variables: A logical variable indicating whether the country is an OECD member, and a fictitious variable stating the date the data was recorded. These variables were added so that all common data-types are represented in this dataset, making it an ideal test-dataset for certain \emph{collapse} functions.

\usage{data("wlddev")}
