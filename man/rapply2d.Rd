\title{
Recursively Apply a Function to a List of Data Objects
}
\description{
\code{rapply2d} is a recursive version of \code{lapply} with two key differences to \code{\link{rapply}}: (1) Data frames are considered as final objects, not as (sub-)lists, and (2) the result is never simplified / unlisted.
}
\usage{
rapply2d(l, FUN, \dots)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{l}{a list.}
  \item{FUN}{a function that can be applied to all elements in l.}
  \item{\dots}{additional elements passed to FUN.}
}
\value{
A list of the same structure as \code{l}, where \code{FUN} was applied to all elements.
