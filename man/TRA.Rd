\title{
Transform Data by (Groupwise) Replacing or Sweeping out Statistics
}
\description{
\code{TRA} is an S3 generic that efficiently transforms data by either (column-wise) replacing data values with supplied statistics or sweeping the statistics out of the data. \code{TRA} supports grouped operations and data frame's, and is thus a generalization of \code{\link{sweep}}.
}
\usage{
TRA(x, STATS, FUN = "-", ...)

\method{TRA}{default}(x, STATS, FUN = "-", g = NULL, ...)

\method{TRA}{matrix}(x, STATS, FUN = "-", g = NULL, ...)

\method{TRA}{data.frame}(x, STATS, FUN = "-", g = NULL, ...)

\method{TRA}{grouped_df}(x, STATS, FUN = "-", keep.group_vars = TRUE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a atomic vector, matrix, data frame or grouped tibble (\code{dplyr::grouped_df}).}
  \item{STATS}{a matching set of summary statistics computed on \code{x}. If \code{g = NULL} (no groups), all methods support an atomic vector of statistics of length \code{NCOL(x)}. The matrix and data.frame methods also support a 1-row matrix or 1-row data.frame/list, respectively. If groups are supplied to \code{g}, \code{STATS} needs to be of the same type as \code{x} and of appropriate dimensions (such that \code{NCOL(x) == NCOL(STATS)} and \code{NROW(STATS)} matches the number of groups supplied to \code{g} i.e. the number of levels if \code{g} is a factor, with the first row of \code{STATS} corresponding to the first level of \code{g} etc...)}
  \item{FUN}{an integer or character string indicating the operation to perform. There are 8 supported operations:
    \tabular{lllll}{\emph{ Int. }   \tab\tab \emph{ String }   \tab\tab \emph{ Description }  \cr % \Sexpr{"\u200B"} \Sexpr{"\u200B"} % \Sexpr{"\u200B"} \Sexpr{"\u200B"}
                 1 \tab\tab "replace_fill"   \tab\tab replace and overwrite missing values \cr % \Sexpr{"\u200B"} \Sexpr{"\u200B"}
                 2 \tab\tab "replace" \tab\tab replace but preserve missing values \cr
                 3 \tab\tab "-"   \tab\tab subtract (center) \cr
                 4 \tab\tab "-+"  \tab\tab subtract group-statistics but add group-frequency weighted average of group statistics (center on global average statistic) \cr
                 5 \tab\tab "/"   \tab\tab divide (scale) \cr
                 6 \tab\tab "\%"     \tab\tab compute percentages (divide and multiply by 100) \cr
                 7 \tab\tab "+" \tab\tab add \cr
                 8 \tab\tab "*" \tab\tab multiply
  }
  }
\item{g}{a factor, \code{\link{GRP}} object, atomic vector (internally converted to ordered factor) or a list of vectors / factors (internally converted to a \code{\link{GRP}} object) used to group \code{x}. Number of groups must match rows of \code{STATS}. See \code{STATS} and Details.}

\item{keep.group_vars}{\emph{grouped_df method:} Logical. Remove grouping variables after computation. In contrast to the other methods, \code{TRA.grouped_df} matches column names exactly, thus \code{STATS} can be any subset of aggregated columns in \code{x} in any order, with or without grouping columns. \code{TRA.grouped_df} will transform the columns in \code{x} with their aggregated versions matched from \code{STATS} (ignoring grouping columns found in \code{x} or \code{STATS} and columns in \code{x} not found in \code{STATS}), and return \code{x} again. If \code{keep.group_vars = FALSE}, \code{x} is returned again without grouping columns. See Details and Examples.}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to or from other methods.}
}

\details{
Without groups (\code{g = NULL}), \code{TRA} is nothing more than a column based version of \code{base::sweep}, albeit 4-times more efficient on matrices and many times more efficient on data frames. \code{TRA} always preserves all attributes of \code{x}.

With groups passed to \code{g}, \code{TRA} expects (and checks for) a set of statistics such that \code{NROW(STATS)} equals the number of groups. If this condition is satisfied, \code{TRA} will (without further checks) assume that the first row of \code{STATS} is the set of statistics computed on the first group of \code{g}, the second row on the second group etc. and do groupwise replacing or sweeping out accordingly.

For example Let \code{x = c(1.2, 4.6, 2.5, 9.1, 8.7, 3.3)}, g is an integer vector in 3 groups \code{g = c(1,3,3,2,1,2)} and \code{STATS = fmean(x,g) = c(4.95, 6.20, 3.55)}. Then \code{out = TRA(x,fmean(x,g),"-",g) = c(-3.75,  1.05, -1.05,  2.90,  3.75, -2.90)} (same as \code{fmean(x, g, TRA = "-")}) does the equivalent to the following for-loop: \code{for(i in 1:6) out[i] = x[i] - fmean(x,g)[g[i]]}.

Correct computation requires that \code{g} as used in \code{fmean} and \code{g} passed to \code{TRA} are exactly the same vector. Using \code{g = c(1,3,3,2,1,2)} for \code{fmean} and \code{g = c(3,1,1,2,3,2)} for \code{TRA} will not give the right result. The safest way of programming with \code{TRA} is thus to repeatedly employ the same factor or \code{\link{GRP}} object for all grouped computations. Atomic vectors passed to \code{g} will be converted to ordered factors (see \code{\link{qF}}) and lists will be converted to ordered \code{\link{GRP}} objects. This is also done by all \link[=A1-fast-statistical-functions]{Fast Statistical Functions} and by default by \code{\link{BY}}, thus together with these functions, \code{TRA} can also safely be used with atomic- or list-groups. Problems may arise if other functions internally convert atomic vectors or lists to groups in a non-sorted way. \emph{Note}: \code{as.factor} conversions are ok as this also involves sorting.

If \code{x} is a grouped tibble (\code{grouped_df}), \code{TRA} matches the columns of \code{x} and \code{STATS} and also checks for grouping columns \code{names(attr(x, "groups"))} in \code{x} and \code{STATS}. \code{TRA.grouped_df} will then only transform those columns in \code{x} for which matching counterparts were found in \code{STATS}, exempting grouping columns, and returns \code{x} again (with columns in the name order). If \code{keep.group_vars = FALSE}, the grouping columns are dropped after computation, however the "groups" attribute is not dropped (it can be removed using \code{dplyr::ungroup()}).

\note{
I have tried to make \code{TRA} as redundant as possible by adding a TRA-argument to all \link[=A1-fast-statistical-functions]{Fast Statistical Functions} (ensuring that the exact same grouping vector is used for aggregation and transformation), and by creating the \code{\link{B}} (between-transform) and \code{\link{W}} (within-transform) operators as well as \code{\link[=fscale]{fscale/STD}} as safer and faster solutions for frequent scaling, centering and averaging tasks. \code{TRA} is really a programmers function for cases when both aggregate statistics and transformed data need to be retained, or to work with more complex statistics (i.e. together with \code{\link{dapply}} or \code{\link{BY}}).
